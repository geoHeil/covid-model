	abstract = {We generate synthetic data documenting COVID-19 cases in Austria by the means of an agent-based simulation model. The model simulates the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a statistical replica of the population and reproduces typical patient pathways on an individual basis while simultaneously integrating historical data on the implementation and expiration of population-wide countermeasures. The resulting data semantically and statistically aligns with an official epidemiological case reporting data set and provides an easily accessible, consistent and augmented alternative. Our synthetic data set provides additional insight into the spread of the epidemic by synthesizing information that cannot be recorded in reality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAustrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) COVID-19 Emergency Call, Vienna Science and Technology Fund WWTF-COVID-19 Rapid Response Funding, Medizinisch-Wissenschaftlicher Fonds des B{\"u}rgermeisters der Bundeshauptstadt Wien, Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) COVID-19 Decision Modeling Initiative.
