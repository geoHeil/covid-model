	abstract = {Background Many countries have already gone through several infection waves and mostly managed to successfully stop the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 through bundles of restrictive measures. Still, the danger of further waves of infections is omnipresent and it is apparent that every containment policy must be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy, before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential breaking of infection chains is a promising strategy to help containing the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown.Objective In this work we aim to quantify the impact of tracing on the containment of the disease and investigate the dynamic effects involved.Design We developed an agent-based model that validly depicts the spread of the disease and allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We apply this model to quantify the impact of divverent variants of contact tracing in Austria and to derive general conclusions on contract tracing.Results The study displays that strict tracing can supplement up to 5\% reduction of infectivity and that household quarantine comes at the smallest price regarding preventively quarantined people.Limitations The results are limited by the validity of the modeling assumptions, model parameter estimates, and the quality of the parametrization data.Conclusions The study shows that tracing is indeed an efficient measure to keep case numbers low but comes at a high price if the disease is not well contained. Therefore, contact tracing must be executed strictly and adherence within the population must be held up to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks of the disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFinancial support for this study was provided in part by Oesterreichische Forschungsfoerderungsgesellschaft, FFG, Wiener Wissenschafts-, Forschungs- und Technologiefonds, WWTF, and Medizinisch-Wissenschaftlicher Fonds des Buergermeisters der Bundeshauptstadt WienAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:there is no ethics committee involvedAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
